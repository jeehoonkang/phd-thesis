\subsection{The C Programming Language}

\paragraph{C as a Hardware Abstraction}

The C programming language is the \emph{lingua franca} for systems programming, mainly due to its
two notable advantages: \emph{portability} and \emph{control} over hardware.  C is portable in that
C programs can be compiled and then executed in most of the existing hardware.  At the same time, C
has a precise control over hardware in that C allows programmers to access relatively low-level
hardware features such as memory layout and concurrency.  These advantages have attracted system
programmers for decades, resulting in a giant ecosystem around the C language itself and tools such
as optimizing compilers, linkers, and program analyzers.

C enjoys portability and control---seemingly conflicting properties---at the same time because it is
a balanced abstraction over various hardware assembly languages.  If C were exposing too much detail
of hardware, then it would have not been able to support some assembly languages that mismatch with
the exposed details, losing a significant degree of portability; on the other hand, if C were
exposing too little detail of hardware, then it would have lost precise control over them.  The
design choice of C as an abstraction is so popular that other systems programming languages---such
as C++, D, Objective C, Swift, Rust---largely follow the design of C and are often called
``C-like''.

% To summarize, the C programming language is an abstraction that should satisfy the desiderata for
% three different ``masters'': portability for programmers, control for hardware, and optimization for
% compilers.

% C---like all the other programming languages---serves multiple ``masters'', namely programmers,
% compilers, and hardware.  From programmer's point of view, C should support \emph{reasoning
%   principles} that are powerful enough to reason about real-world C programs and guarantee their
% safety and functional correctness.  On the other hand, C should validate compiler and hardware
% \emph{optimizations} that may vastly accelerate the execution of C programs and are therefore
% actually performed in the real-world compilers and hardware.  What is particularly interesting about
% C is that TODO.


\paragraph{Compiler Optimization}

However, C is not just a thin wrapper around assembly languages because of compiler optimizations.
Compiler optimizations have been so crucial for the performance of systems since the early days that
every system programmer expect a compiler to perform, \eg{} register promotion and register
allocation~\cite{reg-prom, reg-alloc}, which are very effective and yet quite sophisticated compiler
optimizations.  Compiler optimizations are becoming more and more important these days because
recent trends offer potential for compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of
systems.  Since compiler optimizations are an essential ingredient of the real-world practice of C,
C should be an abstraction not only over just hardware assembly languages but also over compiler
optimizations.

% system programmers are building bigger systems, which they cannot hand-optimize on their own; and
% hardware vendors are introducing complex features, which need a special attention for maximal
% utilization.

% These days the mainstream compilers are becoming so aggressive in these days that they are
% performing even subtle optimizations that cannot be immediately justified.

Some compiler optimizations are so subtle that they cannot be immediately justified.  For example,
consider the following optimization that is actually performed by the mainstream compilers such as
GCC~\cite{gcc} and LLVM~\cite{llvm}:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\begin{minipage}{0.27\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void f() {
  10: int x = 42;
  20: g();
  30: print(x);
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
&
\optarrow
&
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void f() {
  10: int x = 42;
  20: g();
  30: print(42); // const. prop.
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{array}\]

\noindent Suppose \code{g()} is an external function whose body is unknown to the compiler, and
\code{print($x$)} prints the value of $x$ to the screen.  The function \code{f()} first assigns
\code{42} to \code{x} (line \code{10}), calls \code{g()} (line \code{20}), and then prints \code{x}
(line \code{30}).  Mainstream compilers replaces \code{x} with \code{42} at line \code{30},
effectively propagating the constant \code{42} at line \code{10} to line \code{30}.  Compilers
perform such a \emph{constant propagation} optimization because they analyze that the variable
\code{x} is accessible only within the function \code{f()} and thus \code{g()} cannot modify the
content of \code{x}.

But what if an adversarial \code{g()} tries to ``guess'' the address of \code{x} as follows?
%
\[
\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void g() {
  10: int anchor;
  20: int *guess = &anchor + 10; // guessing &x
  30: *guess = 666;
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\]
%
\noindent The function \code{g()} tries to guess the address of \code{x} by exploiting the fact that
stack usually grows downwards: it first declares a variable \code{anchor}, and guesses that
\code{\&x} is 10 words bigger than \code{\&anchor}.  The guess happens to be correct when compiled
with GCC 8.2.1 in Linux 4.18: indeed, when this \code{g()} is linked with the original \code{f()},
\code{f()} will surprisingly print the evil value 666; on the other hand, when this \code{g()} is
linked with the optimized \code{f()}, \code{f()} will print the propagated value 42 as
expected.\footnote{TODO: concretely, \code{gcc -fno-stack-protector assets/example1.c \&\& ./a.out}
  prints 666, while \code{gcc -fno-stack-protector assets/example1-opt.c \&\& ./a.out} prints 42.}
This example invalidates the compiler's analysis that \code{x} is accessible only within the
function \code{f()}, putting the soundness of the optimization in danger.

In order to rescue the constant propagation and other compiler optimizations, C blames the
adversarial code by marking it as invoking \emph{undefined behavior}~\cite{undefined-behavior}: the
function \code{g()} is not following the rule of C so that compilers can do anything it chooses,
even ``to make demons fly out of your nose''~\cite{nasal-demons}.  Concretely, \code{g()} invokes
undefined behavior in the ISO C11~\cite{c11} because the pointer \code{guess} is outside of the
valid range of the memory allocation of \code{anchor}, from which $\code{guess}$ is derived from,
and thus \code{guess} is an invalid address~\cite{c11-6.5.6p8}.  Thus compilers may safely assume
that all the pointers derived from \code{anchor} \emph{shall} point to \code{anchor}, and a failure
to conform with such an assumption invokes undefined behavior.

What is particularly interesting about C is the widespread use of undefined behavior in defining
language semantics.  The constant propagation example above shows that the low-level control over
memory layout conflicts with a simple compiler optimization, and C resolves the conflict by marking
adversarial programs as invoking undefined behaviors.  C generally applies this strategy to the
conflict between control over various low-level details of hardware and various compiler
optimizations implemented in mainstream C compilers, introducing a lot of undefined behaviors in the
language semantics.  It is worth comparing C with higher-level languages---such as Java, .NET,
OCaml, Haskell---that do not need undefined behaviors to justify compiler optimizations thanks to
the lack of control over low-level details of hardware.  For example, since buffer overrun in Java
throws exceptions, TODO.


\subsection{Reckless Development of Undefined Behavior}

The problem is that the C programming language is developed in a reckless manner,

TODO: description so far is informal at best.

TODO: ``towards'': it's not the end.  in some sense, it's just a beginning...  but we dealt very
important and difficult aspects of C.
