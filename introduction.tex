\subsection{The Context: The C Programming Language}

\paragraph{C as a Hardware Abstraction}

The C programming language is the \emph{lingua franca} for systems programming, mainly due to its
two notable advantages: \emph{portability} and \emph{control} over hardware.  C is portable in that
C programs can be compiled and then executed in most of the existing hardware.  At the same time, C
has a precise control over hardware in that C allows programmers to access relatively low-level
hardware features such as memory layout and concurrency.  These advantages have attracted system
programmers for decades, resulting in a giant ecosystem around the C language itself and tools such
as optimizing compilers, linkers, and program analyzers.

C enjoys portability and control---seemingly conflicting properties---at the same time because it is
a balanced abstraction over various hardware assembly languages.  If C were exposing too much detail
of hardware, then it would have not been able to support some assembly languages that mismatch with
the exposed details, losing a significant degree of portability; on the other hand, if C were
exposing too little detail of hardware, then it would have lost precise control over them.  The
design choice of C as an abstraction is so popular that other systems programming languages---such
as C++, D, Objective C, Swift, Rust---largely follow the design of C and are often called
``C-like''.

% To summarize, the C programming language is an abstraction that should satisfy the desiderata for
% three different ``masters'': portability for programmers, control for hardware, and optimization for
% compilers.

% C---like all the other programming languages---serves multiple ``masters'', namely programmers,
% compilers, and hardware.  From programmer's point of view, C should support \emph{reasoning
%   principles} that are powerful enough to reason about real-world C programs and guarantee their
% safety and functional correctness.  On the other hand, C should validate compiler and hardware
% \emph{optimizations} that may vastly accelerate the execution of C programs and are therefore
% actually performed in the real-world compilers and hardware.  What is particularly interesting about
% C is that TODO.


\paragraph{Compiler Optimization}

However, C is not just a thin wrapper around assembly languages because of compiler optimizations.
Compiler optimizations have been so crucial for the performance of systems since the early days that
every system programmer expect a compiler to perform, \eg{} register promotion and register
allocation~\cite{reg-prom, reg-alloc}, which are very effective and yet quite sophisticated compiler
optimizations.  Compiler optimizations are becoming more and more important these days because
recent trends offer potential for compiler optimizations to further improve the performance of
systems.  Since compiler optimizations are an essential ingredient of the use of C, C should be an
abstraction not only over just hardware assembly languages but also compiler optimizations.

% system programmers are building bigger systems, which they cannot hand-optimize on their own; and
% hardware vendors are introducing complex features, which need a special attention for maximal
% utilization.


The problem is that the mainstream compilers are becoming so aggressive in these days that they are
performing even subtle optimizations that cannot be immediately justified.  For example, consider
the following optimization actually performed by the mainstream compilers such as GCC~\cite{gcc} and
LLVM~\cite{llvm}:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\begin{minipage}{0.27\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void f() {
  10: int x = 42;
  20: g();
  30: print(x);
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
&
\optarrow
&
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void f() {
  10: int x = 42;
  20: g();
  30: print(42); // const. prop.
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{array}\]

\noindent Suppose \code{g()} is an external function whose body is unknown to the compiler, and
\code{print($x$)} prints the value of $x$ to the screen.  The function \code{f()} first assigns
\code{42} to \code{x} (line \code{10}), calls \code{g()} (line \code{20}), and then prints \code{x}
(line \code{30}).  Mainstream compilers replaces \code{x} with \code{42} at line \code{30},
effectively propagating the constant \code{42} at line \code{10} to line \code{30}.  Compilers
perform such a \emph{constant propagation} optimization because the variable \code{x} is accessible
only within the function \code{f()} so that \code{g()} cannot modify the content of \code{x}.

But what if an adversarial \code{g()} tries to ``guess'' the address of \code{x} as follows?
%
\[
\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{c}
void g() {
  10: int anchor;
  20: int *guess = &anchor + 10; // guessing &x
  30: *guess = 666;
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\]
%
\noindent The function \code{g()} tries to guess the address of \code{x} by exploiting the fact that
stack usually grows downwards: it first declares a variable \code{anchor}, and guesses that
\code{&x} is 10 words bigger than \code{&anchor}.  The guess happens to be correct when compiled
with GCC 8.2.1 in Linux 4.18: indeed, when this \code{g()} is linked with the original \code{f()},
\code{f()} will print the evil value 666; on the other hand, when this \code{g()} is linked with the
optimized \code{f()}, \code{f()} will print the propagated value 42 as expected.\footnote{TODO:
  concretely, \code{gcc -fno-stack-protector assets/example1.c \&\& ./a.out} prints 666, while
  \code{gcc -fno-stack-protector assets/example1-opt.c \&\& ./a.out} prints 42.}  This example
invalidates the compiler's assumption that \code{x} is accessible only within the function
\code{f()}, jeopardizing the soundness of the optimization.

TODO: Undefined behavior to the rescue!

Obviously we want compilers to perform the above optimization, because the reasoning we described
above is ``right'': indeed, \code{g()} \emph{shall} be oblivious to even the existence of \code{x}
so that a call to \code{g()} shall not modify \code{x} at all.  TODO: \code{g()} is evil (undefined
behavior).

What is particularly interesting of C compiler optimizations is that
