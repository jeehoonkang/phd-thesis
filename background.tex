\section{Background: A Brief Tour of CompCert}
\label{sec:background}

We begin by briefly reviewing the technical background that informs the rest of the dissertation,
using CompCert as the learning material.  We first explain CompCert's organization
(\Cref{sec:background:organization}), and its correctness statement as well as its closed-simulation
verification method (\Cref{sec:background:correctness}).  To flesh out the details on formal
semantics and compiler verification, we use constant propagation---one of CompCert's
optimizations---as a running example.  Specifically, We review the RTL language on which constant
propagation is performed (\Cref{sec:background:rtl}), how constant propagation works
(\Cref{sec:background:opt}), and how CompCert verifies it (\Cref{sec:background:verification}).
