\section{Background: A Brief Tour of CompCert}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, before delving into the main contributions, we first provide the technical
background that informs the rest of the dissertation.  Specifically, we explain CompCert's formal
semantics of C, assembly languages, and intermediate representations (IR), and the soundness proof
of its transformation and optimization passes, based on which we develop the main body of this
dissertation.
