\section{Background: A Brief Tour of CompCert}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we first provide the technical background that informs the rest of the
dissertation.  Specifically, we explain CompCert's formal semantics of C, assembly languages, and
intermediate representations (IR), and the soundness proof of its transformation and optimization
passes, based on which we develop the main contributions of this dissertation.
