This work presents a preliminary evaluation of the use of the CompCert formally specified and verified  optimizing compiler for the development of level A critical flight control software. First, the motivation for choosing CompCert is presented, as well as the requirements and constraints for safety-critical avionics software. The main point is to allow optimized code generation by relying on the formal proof of correctness instead of the current un-optimized generation required to produce assembly code structurally similar to the algorithmic language (and even the initial models) source code. The evaluation of its performance (measured using WCET) is presented and the results are compared to those obtained with the currently used compiler. Finally, the paper discusses verification and certification issues that are raised when one seeks to use CompCert for the development of such critical software. }

volume="10",
number="1",
pages="54--81",
abstract="Happens-before memory model (HMM) is used as the basis of Java memory model (JMM). Although HMM itself is simple, some complex axioms have to be introduced in JMM to prevent the causality loop, which causes absurd out-of-thin-air reads that may break the type safety and security guarantee of Java. The resulting JMM is complex and difficult to understand. It also has many anti-intuitive behaviors, as demonstrated by the ``ugly examples'' by Aspinall and {\v{S}}ev{\v{c}}{\'i}k [1]. Furthermore, HMM (and JMM) specifies only what execution traces are acceptable, but says nothing about how these traces are generated. This gap makes it difficult for static reasoning about programs.",

of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}

of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}
