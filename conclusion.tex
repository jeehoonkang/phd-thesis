% As future work, by further pursuing the research agenda for the formalization of real-world practice
% of C semantics and compilers, we aim to provide clear, theoretically-informed, and
% practically-relevant C semantics and compilers that system programmers can immediately benefit from.
% If successful, our formal semantics will be able to replace the C dialects used in Linux and other
% systems.
